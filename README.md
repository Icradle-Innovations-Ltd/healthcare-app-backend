1. Configuration (config/)
auth.js: Configures authentication methods, such as token generation, expiration settings, and refresh token policies.
database.js: Manages database connection settings (e.g., database URI, connection pooling) and handles reconnection attempts in case of failures.
db.js: A central connection handler to initialize and maintain the database connection pool.
permissions.js: Contains logic to define different user permissions, detailing which roles can access specific routes and services.
roles.js: Defines user roles (e.g., doctor, admin, patient) and associates each role with permissions, helping enforce role-based access control across the app.
2. Controllers (controllers/)
Controllers handle requests from clients, interact with services to retrieve or manipulate data, and send responses back to clients.
adminController.js: Manages admin operations such as user account management, role assignments, and audit logging.
authController.js: Handles user login, logout, registration, and token refresh functionality.
billingController.js: Processes billing information, invoice generation, payment tracking, and handles billing inquiries.
doctorController.js: Manages doctor profiles, schedules, patient assignments, and other doctor-related functionalities.
facilityController.js: Manages healthcare facility information, including location, services provided, and facility availability.
inventoryController.js: Handles medical inventory management, including supplies, medicines, and equipment tracking.
medicalRecordController.js: Manages patient medical records, including creation, updates, and secure access.
patientController.js: Manages patient profiles, health data, and other patient-specific features.
patientPortalController.js: Provides access to the patient portal, allowing patients to view medical records, schedule appointments, and communicate with doctors.
roleController.js: Manages user roles, allowing admins to assign, update, or revoke roles.
visitorController.js: Manages visitor access, schedules, and tracks visits within the facility.
3. Jobs (jobs/)
Scheduled tasks or background processes that improve the app's functionality without blocking the main application flow.
appointmentReminder.js: Sends appointment reminders to patients via email/SMS to reduce no-shows.
dataBackup.js: Regularly backs up critical data, ensuring the system can recover from data loss.
reportGenerator.js: Generates periodic reports (e.g., usage statistics, billing summaries) for administrators.
4. Middlewares (middlewares/)
Middlewares process requests before reaching controllers, adding layers of functionality like validation, logging, and error handling.
authMiddleware.js: Ensures users are authenticated before accessing protected routes.
errorHandler.js: Catches errors and formats responses to ensure users get consistent error messages.
middlewares.js: An aggregator file that imports and organizes all middleware.
patientValidation.js: Validates patient-related requests to ensure data integrity (e.g., checking required fields for creating a patient profile).
rateLimiter.js: Controls request rates from individual IPs, protecting against spam or DDoS attacks.
responseHandler.js: Standardizes response formatting for consistency across the app.
roleMiddleware.js: Restricts access to certain routes based on user roles.
validation.js: General validation middleware, used across multiple routes to enforce input constraints.
5. Models (models/)
Models represent data schemas and are directly linked to the database, allowing CRUD operations on various data entities.
Appointment.js: Defines the structure of appointment data, including patient and doctor references, times, and status.
Doctor.js: Manages doctor profiles, specialties, qualifications, and schedule data.
Facility.js: Represents healthcare facilities, with fields for location, services, and operational status.
HealthRecord.js: Represents health records, storing a patient's medical history and healthcare interactions.
MedicalRecord.js: Contains detailed medical records per patient, such as diagnosis, prescriptions, and lab results.
Patient.js: Represents patient profiles with personal details, contact information, and health records.
Provider.js: Stores information about healthcare providers and their affiliations.
Service.js: Represents various healthcare services offered, including descriptions and pricing.
User.js: Manages core user data such as credentials, roles, and personal information.
6. Reports (reports/)
Stores reports generated by the application, such as billing summaries, patient visit logs, and inventory audits, which administrators can access for insights and analytics.
7. Routes (routes/)
Defines the accessible API endpoints and associates them with relevant controllers.
adminRoutes.js: Routes for admin-specific actions like user management and system settings.
appointmentRoutes.js: Routes for handling appointment-related actions (scheduling, cancellations, reminders).
authRoutes.js: Authentication-related routes, such as login, logout, and registration.
doctorRoutes.js: Routes for doctor operations, including profile management and patient access.
patientRoutes.js: Routes for patient-related activities, such as viewing records, updating profiles, and booking appointments.
portalRoutes.js: Provides access to the patient portal for secure interactions between patients and healthcare providers.
visitorRoutes.js: Manages visitor access, such as check-ins, approvals, and scheduling visits.
8. Services (services/)
Service layer for core business logic, separating it from controllers to keep the code modular.
